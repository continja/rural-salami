{{< /alert >}}

### Details: How to Play On-Demand

The show plays **ON-DEMAND** and controlled by you!

1. Tune your radio to **87.9FM**.
2. Text **go** to the number displayed on the garage.

Once triggered, the show starts a new session with a unique, randomized playlist and plays the first set of songs.

* **For the next set:** Text **go** again.
* **Variety Guaranteed:** Because the show plays in short sets and randomizes the playlist for each new session, you won't see repeat songs, and you can enjoy as much as you like!
* **Playlist Reset**: If the show isn't triggered for ~10 minutes, the session automatically resets for the next visitor.

For more control, like playing specific songs, check out the [full 2025 Thanksgiving Show Page](https://lightsongranger.com/shows/2025-thanksgiving-light-show/).
