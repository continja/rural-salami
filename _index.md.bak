        * **When:** Now through Sun, December 28. 
        * **Where:** 2303 Granger Ln, Cedar Park, TX 78613

        ## On-Demand

        ### Hours

        * **Sun - Thu:** Sunset to 9:30pm
        * **Fri - Sat:** Sunset to 11:00pm
        <p class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        <strong>Service Availability:</strong> On-demand is active <strong>only</strong> when you see the number displayed on the garage. If you don't see it, the feature is off (outside of show hours or due to maintenance).</strong>
        </p>

        ### Details: How to Play On-Demand

        The show plays **ON-DEMAND** and controlled by you!

        <p class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
        Want to play a specific song? Give it a try here -> <strong><a href="/shows/2025-christmas-light-show/">Christmas 2025 Show</a></strong>.
        </p>

        1. Tune your radio to **87.9FM**.
        2. Text **go** to the number displayed on the garage.

        Once triggered, the show starts a new session with a unique, randomized playlist and plays the first set of songs.

        * **For the next set:** Text **go** again.
        * **Variety Guaranteed:** Because the show plays in short sets and randomizes the playlist for each new session, you won't see repeat songs, and you can enjoy as much as you like!
        * **Playlist Reset**: If the show isn't triggered for ~10 minutes, the session automatically resets for the next visitor.

        For more control, like playing specific songs, check out the [full 2025 Christmas Show Page](/shows/2025-christmas-light-show/).
